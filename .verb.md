## CLI usage

Once both [generate][] and `{%= name %}` are installed globally, run the following command to run this generator's default task:

```sh
$ gen breakdance
```

## Available tasks

All tasks beside the default task are run by appending the task name to `breakdance:`.

{%= apidocs('generator.js') %}


## API usage

To extend your own generator with the tasks and functionality of `{%= name %}`, inside your generator add the following line of code:

```js
app.use(require('{%= name %}'));
```
